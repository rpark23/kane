                            The needs of our early Hawaiian ancestors were simple. 
                            The pleasant climate demanded very little in the way of personal comfort. 
                            Their primary concern were the gathering and preparation of food, construction, sailing, warfare, 
                            and the appeasement of their Ali’i and Gods.
                            <br><br>
                            In each activity, fiber work was a key component. 
                            The book Ancient Hawaiian Civilization noted, “ they needed baskets and slings to carry food; 
                            nets, lines, and snares for fishing; mats and thatching for homes; sails, ropes, and lashing for canoes; 
                            slings and lashing cords for weapons; and the network background for their beautiful feather work”, 
                            that adorned their Ali’i and their Gods.
                            <br><br>
                            To this end, early Hawaiians had to first seek out various raw materials that could be used in 
                            fiber work. Thus, fiber material had to be not only strong but pliable; straight but smooth; 
                            and long but tough. By identifying useful and reliable raw materials, 
                            early Hawaiians learned to propagate these materials for on-going use as Kaula [cordage].
